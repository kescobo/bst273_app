# Instructions

1. fork this repo to your github account (this happens on the site)
2. clone your new fork to your local computer (hint: `$ git clone ...`)
3. change the name in `my_variables.py` to your name and save the file
4. make a commit to record that change (you probably need to use `git add`, `git commit`, and `git push`)
5. make a pull request from your fork to the original repo
